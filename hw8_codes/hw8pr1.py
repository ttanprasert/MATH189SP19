"""
Starter file for k-means(hw8pr1) of Big Data Summer 2017

The file is seperated into two parts:
	1) the helper functions
	2) the main driver.

The helper functions are all functions necessary to finish the problem.
The main driver will use the helper functions you finished to report and print
out the results you need for the problem.

Before attemping the helper functions, please familiarize with pandas and numpy
libraries. Tutorials can be found online:
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html

Please COMMENT OUT any steps in main driver before you finish the corresponding
functions for that step. Otherwise, you won't be able to run the program
because of errors.

After finishing the helper functions for each step, you can uncomment
the code in main driver to check the result.

Note:
1. When filling out the functions below, remember to
	1) Let m be the number of samples
	2) Let n be the number of features
	3) Let k be the number of clusters

2. Please read the instructions and hints carefully, and use the name of the
variables we provided, otherwise, the function may not work.

3. Remember to comment out the TODO comment after you finish each part.

			2) k, the number of clusters
			3) eps, the threshold of the norm of the change in clusters
			4) max_iter, the maximum number of iterations
			5) print_freq, the frequency of printing the report

		This function returns the following:
			1) clusters, a list of clusters with dimension k x 1
			2) label, the label of cluster for each data with dimension m x 1
			3) cost_list, a list of costs at each iteration

			1) Use np.argsort to get the index of the sorted array
			2) Use copy.deepcopy(A) to make a deep copy of an object A
			3) Calculate cost with k_means_cost()
			2) Each iteration consists of two steps:
				a) finding the closest center for each data point
				b) update the centers according to the data points

			1) We use l2-norm as the distance metric
